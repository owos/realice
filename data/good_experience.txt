 It was late in the evening, around Ozumba Mbasiwe Avenue, the bus I entered broke down. The area 
has become somewhat notorious for robbery and other vices. 
The driver’s assistant refused to refund our money and other buses were filled. While we were having a 
scuffle, the RRS team on a patrol came and asked the driver and his assistant to refund the passengers. 
No arrest was made.
