IMPORTANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS
suggestions :
  Government should pay them well and the laws in the land should be very clear to us all
suggestions :

suggestions :
 The people who are meant to be protecting us are supposed to be well fed and taken care. That is to 
say that their salary and allowances should be greatly improved....then a system of fishing out the 
criminals disguising as Police officers should be introduced. E.g whistle blowing policy etc.
suggestions :
  The Nigerian Police should try as much as possible to gain back the confidence of the people because 
so many things is happening in the society and the people are afraid to report. When you do report 
you'll be the culprit. So they should show love to the people and make them know that they're there to 
serve and protect them. 
suggestions :
  Conduct Enlightenment programs for the police and punish offenders in their ranks
suggestions :
  They should be educated on how to effectively carry out their assignments
suggestions :
  They need to engage in martial arts, basic health and technology trainings, better welfare packages , 
emotional intelligence training and post-service training. So that while in service, they can serve better 
and after service they are not rendered redundant because they lack skills that will make them useful 
aside learning to use firearms. 
More so, the development will encourage others to take up service works. As most people already have 
disdain for the work. They see it as an escape from lack of employment
